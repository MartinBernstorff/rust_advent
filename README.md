# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust
My stabs at Advent of Code 2022 in Rust. Just having a bit of fun here; coming from Python, it's fun to try TDD-style algorithm-development in a blazingly fast language.

My process has been: 
1) Solve the problem myself
2) Look at fasterthanli.me's solution to get feedback on idiomatic rust
3) Improve my solution based on that

This has been a great learning experience!
